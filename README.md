# Fine-tuning-for-Image-Classification-with-Transformers
This project fine-tunes a vision transformer model pre-trained on ImageNet to classify images of 20 wildlife species from the Oregon Wildlife dataset. The project uses Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch libraries and can be run on Google Colab or locally.
